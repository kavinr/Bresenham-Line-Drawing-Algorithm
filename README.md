# Bresenham-Line-Drawing-Algorithm
Verilog implementation of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm. 

Takes start and end coordinates as inputs and draws a line on the frame of a video. 

linedraw.v is the file that contains the algorithm.

*****************
The design uses a 256x256 frame buffer, with a 4-bit intensity value for each of the 65,536 pixels. The frame buffer is implemented as a dual-ported RAM, with one port for the line drawing algorithm and the other port for the display generation process. This frame buffer is not included in this repository but can be generated by following the tutorial on the design document.
*****************

This design is targeted towards Basysâ„¢3 Artix-7 FPGA Board.
